# Personal-Website
Thought I'd try to create a website from scratch. Very much a WIP, but will gradually continue it.

Jan 5, 2023: started barebones of website. Using codepen.io to preview the site as I code it.
Next steps:
*bullet list finish aligning/formatting image (center, border, circle). Add info to page.
*bullet list Connectivity to navbar and start the next webpages
*bullet list Footer
*bullet list Add information + general formatting
